# QuranClassification
The purpose of this project is to recognise the ayah a person is reciting from the Quran and then return the relevant tafseer for this ayah. It utilises an API and pretained transcribing model to achieve this.

The input of the program is an audio recording of the user reciting an ayah of the holy Quran. The whisper model is used to transcribe the recording into arabic text. I then normalised the text by stripping it of harakat and other characteristics. This ensures that when I compare it to a list of normalised ayahs there are no inconsistencies. The next step is using a downloaded text file from of all ayahs from the Quran, labeled by surah and ayah. I normalise this file using the same function. I then use cosine similarity to compare the similarity between each ayah and the transcribed ayah. The one with the highest similarity is identified as the same ayah and then using its respective surah and ayah numbers, the program fetches a tafseer from the Quran.com API.
